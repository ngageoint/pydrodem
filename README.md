## pydrodem
hydrologically conditions elevation data to derive stream networks and basins.

### Origin
pydrodem was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) by federal government employees in the course of their official duties, so it is <strong>not</strong> subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain in the United States. 

You are free to use the core public domain portions of pydrodem for any purpose. Modifications back to the cores of any dependency functions are subject to the original licenses and are separate from the core public domain work of FDE. 

### Transparency
NGA is posting code created by government officers in their official duties in transparent platforms to increase the impact and reach of taxpayer-funded code. NGA is also posting pydrodem to give NGA partners insight into how elevation data is quality controlled within NGA to help partners understand parts of quality assurance checks.

### Pull Requests

This project is in the public domain within the United States and all changes to the core public domain portions will be released back into the public domain. By submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest. Modifications to dependencies under copyright-based open source licenses are subject to the original license conditions.
